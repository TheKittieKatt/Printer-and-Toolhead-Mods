Box Turtle Skirting

I loved the Box Turtle skirting that was created by MakerMylo but, I wanted to put smaller hexagons inside the larger ones.   There is a way to do this in the slicer, but my ocd said I wanted them all centered and perfect, so I modified their files.   

All credit for the design goes to MakerMylo!!!   Here is a link to the original mod.
