This is a direct replacement for the standard exhaust port cover.    This allows for the mounting of a BTT SFS 2.0 filament runout sensor.   You will need 3x m3 counter sunk screws to mount the sensor to the bracket.   

Side Note:   I found the pull lever on the BTT SFS 2.0 likes to unthread.   I have found that taking the sensor apart and carefully putting a little Loctite on the threads for this greatly helps solve this problem!
