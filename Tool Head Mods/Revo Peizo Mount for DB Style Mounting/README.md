Revo Peizo Mount for DB Style Mounting

I was going to attempt to run Revo Peizo on a Dragon Burner, but I was never happy with it.   To make this work I designed a mount that replaces the Beacon/Cartographer mounting with one that would work with the Peizo board.   The mount takes 2x m2 heat sets to hold the board to the mount.   I also had to modify the limit switch protrusion for the mounting bracket to allow the Peizo board to rise it high enough to keep it further away from the bed.
